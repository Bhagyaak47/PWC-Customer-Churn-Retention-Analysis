PwC Power BI Virtual Case Experience Task 2- Customer Retention and Churn Analysis Dashboard

# Problem Statement
In this project Create a dashboard in Power BI for the PhoneNow Company that reflects the Churn analysis and Customer Information for further decision making and strategies for customer retention. The telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

1.Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
2.The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination
3.Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk
4.We have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end  
5.We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management.
